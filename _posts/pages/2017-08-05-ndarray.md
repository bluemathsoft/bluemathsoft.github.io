A central data structure in BlueMath is N-dimensional array - [NDArray](/docs/classes/ndarray.html)

It is used to transfer data to and from the BlueMath API as well as internally. It can be used to represent most common 1-dimensional arrays, like Vectors, Coordinates; 2-dimensional arrays like Matrices and any higher dimensional arrays that might suite the purpose at hand.

It is designed after numpy's ndarray data structure and tries to implement same semantics (if not syntax).

The most powerful feature of NDArray is the indexing and slicing features it offers. It offers [get](/docs/classes/ndarray.html#get) and [set](/docs/classes/ndarray.html#set) methods to access and mutate the array contents respectively. These methods take variable number of arguments to specify index inside the array. The index could be full or partial. A full index will resolve to a single element in the array, while a partial index will resolve to a slice of the array. Thus you can use these methods to read or write a subset of the NDArray in shorthand manner.
